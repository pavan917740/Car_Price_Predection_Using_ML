## Project Overview

Predicting car prices is a popular regression problem in machine learning. This project explores the problem using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and various regression algorithms to build an effective predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains various features of cars such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission, and more. (Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for details on the dataset. If you are using your own data, ensure it has similar features.)

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building (Multiple Regression Models)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2)
- Visualization of Results

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pavan917740/Car_Price_Predection_Using_ML.git
    cd Car_Price_Predection_Using_ML
    ```

2. **Install required packages:**
    Recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Or install typical dependencies individually (if `requirements.txt` is not present):
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the notebook file in your browser.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells sequentially to follow data preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and evaluation steps.
3. You can modify the notebook to use your own dataset by replacing the data loading section.

## Results

The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow from data loading to model evaluation. Various regression algorithms (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) are compared to find the best performing model for car price prediction.
